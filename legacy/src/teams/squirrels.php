One cold day back in 1995 Andrew Evan Eckert had a vision. A team for the
Watkins Mill Fantasy Footbal League that wouldn't care about winnning,
they cared about having fun. In the season of 1996, Capt. Eckert's vision
came to life. His team had an amazing debut season at 2 and 10. No ties!
After that killer season the team had an important choice, merge with
another team. Team owner Tim Shoobridge had a team with a winning record,
Tsunami! With Tim's fighting spirit and Andrew's Fun-Lovin' their teams
join to create the Hempaholics. With a tie for first place in their
division, the Hempaholics kick tons of ass. What is in store for this
team? Only the future will tell.
