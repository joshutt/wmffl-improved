Best Team Coordinator - Norsemen
Best General Manager  - Norsemen
Owner of the Year     - Werewolves

Scores for the units are based on actual points scored by activated
players in the Regular Season.  The awards were determined as follows:
Best Team Manager (use to be Best Activator) is based on how
well the team played the players that it has.  It has no regard for
record and is based purely on points scored vs. possible roster points.
The Best General Manager refers to how well the team gets players onto
its roster.  It has nothing to do with whether the correct players are
activated.  Finally, the Owner of the Year is based on three factors;
1) how well players are activated, 2) how well players are obtained and
3) how well the players perform (record, plus a small bonus for playoff
performance.) A complete standing of every team will be on the web page
at http:/wmffl.com by Wednesday morning or e-mail me and I will make
sure that you get it.
