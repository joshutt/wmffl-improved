Warriors-  Are eliminated from the playoffs.

I believe that this takes every possiblity into account.  Every game has
some meaning so it should be an exciting week.  This is a reminder that
whoever does make the playoffs needs to turn in activations before Saturday.
When you turn in activations remember to number your players 1-14 (not your
Head Coach).  In the case of a tie I will compare #1's, then #2, etc.
Failure to number your players will result in automaticly losing a tie game.
