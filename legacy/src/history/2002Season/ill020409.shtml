<P>We would like to take this opportunity to formally announce that the
Hempaholics have disbanded and are no more. We would like to welcome to the
WMFFL the newest most fantastic more powerful team ever, The ILLUMINATI. You
haven't been aware but we have actually been controling the league since its
inception. You will all soon learn to fear the New World Order. The fun
loving lucky go attitude of the Hempaholics has gone up in smoke. From now on
there are no friends...only enemies and bitches that we control. Thank you.
