WMFFL Newsletter Week #3
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================

The Barbarians once again failed to activate a full line up, costing 
them another $8 and 16 points.  In addition this week, one of the 
activations they did have was on a bye which costs them another $1 
and 2 points. 

The Illuminati still have not paid thier entry fee.  They currently 
owe $10.70 (this includes late penalties and extra transaction points,
and does credit wins).  The next $5.00 fine will be assessed on 
Wednesday.  Also, just a reminder (still to early to thing about 
this) that no team may make the playoffs if they haven't paid the 
entry fee and thier account is in defict. 

Last week it was mistakenly reported that the Green Wave were on a 4 
game winning streak.  The streak was actually 5, and thus is now 6.  
It also is only the second time that they have won 3 consecutive 
games in the same season (do the math and you can figure out that the
other time was weeks 12-14 of last season).  

On the dubious side of streaks, the Rednecks (and the ZEN before 
them) now have a 8 game regular season losing streak.  The third 
longest of its kind in league history.  The streak was only broken by
their Toliet Bowl victory.  

Last Week's performance by Joey Porter (LB-PIT) of the Illuminati was
the second highest ever by a linebacker (33) and by any defensive 
player.  Derrick Brooks (LB-TB) of the MeggaMen posted a 23, which is
tied with 2 others for 8th best LB score of all-time.  Also, in week 
1, Priest Holmes (RB-KC) scored 34, which puts him in a 9 way tie for
the 5th best RB performance of all-time.  Holmes also scored 34 in 
the Illuminati playoff game last year, which means he did it in back-
to-back games that he was in.
