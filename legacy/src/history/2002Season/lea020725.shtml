In announcing the changes
John stated "By the way, if anyone is offended (I am not the most PC per 
around), let me know, and I will [give them an introduction to Betty,
my shotgun]." <SUP><A HREF="#sub">*</A></SUP></P>

<P>We have finally found a replacement for ZEN.  John Garner will take
over control of the team, effective immediatly.  He has been playing
fantasy football for at least a couple years.  He has a team in FLOF and
I think he won a championship in an ESPN league (I don't know I might be
making up some bullshit here). Well, he can't possibly do worse than the
disgraceful displays of incompetence that Warren put on through out the
years ;)  When informed he would be receiving the team John made the
following statement "I looked over Zen (your right, not in the best of
shape), and I like a challenge.  Of course...first thing I will HAVE to
do is change the name to something a little better..."  Anyways, we are
glad to have John as a new owner and wish him luck (except when he's
playing the Werewolves, of course).
