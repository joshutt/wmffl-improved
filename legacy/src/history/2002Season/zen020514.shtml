<H1 ALIGN=Center>ZEN Team Owner Retires</H1>
<H3 ALIGN=Center>Denies World Cup Conflict</H3>
<HR size = "1">

<P><I>Saturday, May 11, 2002 (Newark, DE) - </I>
The sordid and checkered past of the
fantasy franchise Team ZEN comes to an end, as the team packs up the newly
relocated training camp and calls it a victorious day.  The two-time league
runners-up and winner of the Blue Division in 1996 will close shop after 9
exciting seasons of participating in arguably the finest private fantasy
league in existence.</P>

<P>After denying rumors of conflict of schedule between fantasy ownership and
World Cup addiction treatment, the owner, manager, and head cheerleader of
the now-defunct team released the following statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"...dry, with extra olives.  Oh! Hi. Yes, it is true that I am withdrawing
Team ZEN from competition in the WMFFL.  It was a hard decision, as it has
been an important social ritual for lo these past nine years.  Although the
watching of (and gambling on) the World Cup of Soccer will occupy many days
this summer, the reasons why I must withdraw have nothing to do with The
Beautiful Game.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"With the fetters associated with an increased course load and having to
continue working fulltime, I just felt it better to end on a high note than
to continue with detrimentally-minimal participation. I have not ruled out a
return to franchise ownership in the future, and will remain on the mailing
list to instigate trash-talking and point and laugh."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>
When reminded that his "high note" is a 1-0 victory in the Toilet Bowl, the
former owner, who made Troy Aikman a #1 pick in the franchise's first draft,
got increasingly belligerent.  "At least we WON the Toilet Bowl.  Besides,
it's not about that one season, it's about being part of a great fantasy
league with a great group of friends, run by one of the smartest guys on the
planet.  I'll miss the draft day drama, the rule bickering, and especially
the trash talking.  I was also looking forward to celebrating the 10-year
anniversary, and potentially more ruined #1 draft picks (hey, at least I
didn't draft Lawrence Philips)."</P>

<P>Five or 8 drink later, the owner allegedly mumbled, "you guys are the
greatest.  Go team!" And fell over and broke his martini glass.  Thus ends
the era of Team ZEN.</P>
