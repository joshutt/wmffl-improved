<HR size = "1">

<P>This year's draft will be held at Jim's house on Sunday, August 18th.
We are going to try and start it at 1:00, so be there earlier than that.
Jim will send out directions in the next couple of days.  After the draft
we planning on having a cookout/party, which family members and others are
welcome to attend.  We would however, like to get a head count and ask
that everyone bring something (chips, drinks, something along those lines).
</P>

<P>As usual we will start the draft off with a rules discussion.  However,
this can hopefully be kept short and will be even shorter if everyone
would vote on the outstanding issues before the draft (hint, hint).</P>

<P>Protections will be due by midnight Sunday, August 11th (that's  the
midnight between Sunday and Monday).  There is a link on the website to
do these online.  Let me know if you have any problems with that
functionality.  </P>

<P>Finally, the league data file for the software is updated and on the
web site.  You will need the most recent version of the software to use
this year's file.  It can be downloaded at
<A HREF="http://fflm.com">http://fflm.com</A>  Version D26
is the most recent and you will want to make sure that you get the
Owner's Assistant version of the software not the commissioners.
(Also, let me know if you have trouble downloading the league file,
I've been having some trouble with anonymous ftp since moving to the
new servers).</P>

<P>I think that's everything for now.  Thanks.</P>

<P>Josh
