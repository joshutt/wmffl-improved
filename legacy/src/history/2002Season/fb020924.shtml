<P><I>Tuesday, September 24, 2002 (Springfield, VA) - </I>
In an effort to retain the team's sanity, the Freezer Burn traded quarterback 
Tom Brady and running back Lamar Smith to the Werewolves for running back 
Ladanian Tomlinson.</P>

<P>"I knew our quarterback depth chart was going to keep Brady on the bench 
unless there was some kind of season ending injury to Donovan Mcnabb," said 
coach Mariucci on Tuesday, "but I didn't think he'd be so <I>annoying</I> 
about it." </P>

<P>"Every week, all I heard from the QB bench was 'putmeincoach putmeincoach 
putmeincoach'; I couldn't concentrate on the game."</P>

<P>Smith was included in the trade, because riding on the plane to Ashburn 
alone was, according to Brady, "scary".<P>

<P>"Tomlinson definitely adds some depth to our team, and I can finally focus 
on the game at hand."</P>

<P>Mariucci will be taking the weekend off to celebrate with his family.
