<P><I>Gnome, Alaska (AP) - </I>

Those crazy War Eagles are at it
again, this time trading away starters Aaron Brooks and
Corey Dillon to the Green Wave in exchange for Daunte
Cullpepper. When informed of the transaction, Head
Coach Andy Ried (of the War Eagles) said "WHAT THE
*%$^# IS THAT MORON THINKING??? DOESN'T HE REALIZE HE
JUST GAVE AWAY %40 OF MY WHOLE #$%^!@#$!@#$ OFFENSE.
DILLON AND BROOKS WERE KEY TO THE TEAMS REVITALIZATION
AND FUTURE PLANS. WHY DIDN'T HE THROW  KEVIN !@#$@#$
JOHNSON IN THE DEAL SO IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY MORONIC.
GOD DAMMIT I'M PISSED." When shown the tape, Owner and
General Manager Jim Bishop said "I had not thought of
including Kevin Johnson in the trade. That actually
makes great sense. Ried has all the hallmarks of a
future front office man." Johnson was promptly issued a
bus ticket to join Brooks and Dillon.</P>

<P>
As Brooks, Dillon, and Johnson boarded a Greyhound bus
bound for Anchorage, all three players were elated to
be leaving town. "Hell ya I am glad to be leaving
here." One player said. "This place is cold, the
organization is a mess, the owner is a fruit loop. Who
would want to stay here? Have you seen the
cheerleaders? I mean come on. They are sending us away
on the same <B>*bus*</B> we ride to away games on. This
organization has no class. You know there are planes in
the lower 48." Daunte Cullpepper could not be reached
for comment although it is telling that broken
furniture was being removed the Green Wave office as
this reporter arrived.</P>

<P>
PS: Ah it is close to football time again. Draft is
very soon folks. I look forward to seeing you all
again. </P>

<P>PPS: Tim congratulations on you wedding. I am not sure
of the exact timeline but marriage is a good thing. I
wish you well.</P>

<P>PPPS: Oh Tim, now that you are married (or soon will
be), make sure you get permission from your wife before
deciding on who the Imuminati are going to let win this
year =^></P>
