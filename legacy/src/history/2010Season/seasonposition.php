<H1 Align=Center>Draft Weight and Schedule</H1>
<HR size = "1">
<P>
The draft order is determined by reverse order of finish, with a
lottery among the non-playoff teams for the first three slots.  The weights
for the lottery will be based on the order of finish.  The draft order will
remain the same throughout the draft.  Shown below is a
table of every team's possible draft positions and lottery weight.</P>

<P>In addition to the draft order, the schedule is partially based on
order of finish.  Every team plays every other team in their division
2 times and every team in the opposing division once.  However, that only
leaves 13 games.  The remaining game comes from playing one team in
the opposing division a second time.  The teams that finished in the same
relative position the year before meet in this extra game.  Below are the
extra game matchups for next season.</P>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Norsemen - MeggaMen</li>
<li>Sacks on the Beach - Whiskey Tango</li>
<li>Werewolves - Gallic Warriors</li>
<li>Pretend I'm Not Here - Fighting Squirrels</li>
<li>Lindbergh Baby Casserole - Crusaders</li>
</ul></p>
