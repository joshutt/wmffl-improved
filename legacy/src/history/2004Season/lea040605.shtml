<P>
<I>June 5, 2003</I> - In a much anticipated move, the new owner of the Green Wave, Chris Heywood, changed the name of his team.  The team will now be known as the Gallic Warriors.  This marks the fifth name that the franchise has held in it's 11 year history.  Previous names were Zebus, Cloakers, Iradicators and Green Wave.  There is no truth to the rumor that Bobby Rainey is in any way connected to the new ownership.
