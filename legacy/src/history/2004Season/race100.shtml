<h4>Through Week 10</h4>
<p>The race to be the first franchise to win 100 regular season games is now also a race against time.  The Illuminati have already fallen off the chart and can't get there this season.  The Werewolves have no room for error, one more lose or tie and they can not achieve 100 this season.  The Crusaders and Norsemen are both sitting at 97 wins and can only afford 1 loss or tie.  Below are each team in the running and the number of regular season wins they have.  In parenthsis is the team that they would get win number 100 against if they won all remaining games.</p>
