<P>
<I>September 24, 2004</I> - There is a potential that the Steelers-Dolphins game will NOT take place on Sunday due to the approaching Hurricane.  They have said definativly that it will not be moved to Saturday, so this shouldn't effect activations.  It sounds like it could however, be moved to Monday or Tuesday.  Obviously, if the game is played on Tuesday the results of the week will be delayed till Wednesday morning.  If by some bizarre chance the game is not played at all (I can't imagine this happening, but just in case) I'll allow anyone that activated a PIT or MIA player to submit an alternate starting player, via email.  Naturally, such a player must be designated prior to the activation deadline.  In addition no one will be penalized for bye week activations occuring as a result of this event.</p>

<p>Regardless, we should know by tomorrow what they are going to do, but I just wanted to provide as much time as possible for people to make whatever adjustments they need to.
