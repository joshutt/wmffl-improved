<P>
<I>July 11, 2004</I> - 
So after reviewing everyone's options for when to hold the draft, the
overwhelming favorite was Saturday, August 28th.  Only one person was unable to
make it that day and he said that it is not ideal, but that he could probably
make it anyway.  So I'm expecting a very strong turnout.  The draft will most
likely be held at Andy's house in Germantown, but I do need to confirm that
with him.  So directions, etc will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>As a result of the draft on the 28th, protections will be due at 11:59 pm on
August 21st.  Also, the final draft order will be determined no later than
August 14th, mostly likely it'll be done before the end of July.
