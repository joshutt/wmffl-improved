<P>Just thought that I'd let everyone know that I am back in town.

I would like to thank Tim for doing a great job sending out the

newsletter last week (with the correct scores and everything!!)

I have updated the web page to reflect last week's scores.  Also,

a quick reminder that the transaction deadline is coming soon.

The deadline is noon on Sunday, November 21, only 2 weeks away.

If you want to improve your team, now is the time to do it.  Thanks.</P>
