<HR size = "1">
Here is a complete list of the proposed rule changes for the 1999 season.
If you have any that you would like to add, please send email to
proposals.

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.1 - Forced Fumbles</B><BR>
This would complete last year's agreement by making forced fumbles worth 3
pts for defensive players while fumble recoverys would be worth 2 pts.  This
was agreed upon, but the forced fumbles stat was not available until mid
season, so that category was left off.</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.2 - Reception Points</B><BR>
This would revise the way that reception points are given out to offensive
players.  There are two proposals, both were made by the Crusaders.<BR>
Alternative 1; 1 pt for 3 rec, 1 pt for 5 rec, 1 pt per rec above 6, 2 pts
per rec above 12<BR>
Alternative 2; 1 pt for 2 rec, 1 pt for 4 rec, 1 pt per rec above 5, 2 pts
per rec above 12</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.3 - Tie-breakers</B><BR>
This proposal would add a new tie-breaker in the third slot.  It would apply
only to teams in the same division and is record within that division.  This
proposal was made by the Crusaders</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.4 - Missing the Draft</B><BR>
This proposal would change the pre-protection award for missing the draft
from 3 protections and 2 transaction to 2 protections and 3 transactions.
This was proposed by the Werewolves.</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.5 - Increasing Entry Fee</B><BR>
This would increase the entry fee from $30 to $50, effective this season.
If passed on the day of the draft the entry fee grace period will be
extended until the date of the first NFL game.</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.6 - Roster Size</B><BR>
This proposal would reduce the size of rosters over a two year period.  This
year the number of RB and WR on a roster would be reduced to 4 each, thus
reducing the total roster to 28.  Next year the roster would be reduced to
25 with no position restrictions.</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.7 - Illegial Lineup</B><BR>
If a team does not have the appropriate number of players to field a valid
starting line-up, at the time in which the activations are due, then that
team will forfeit the game in question.  If the situation is not corrected by
the following week then they will continue forfeiting until a valid
lineup is available.</P>

<P>
<B>Proposal 99.8 - Extra Pre-Season Transaction</B><BR>
The Hempaholics have proposed that since the draft will be so far before the
start of the regular season that every team be granted an extra transaction
point that may be used in the pre-season only.  If unused this point would
disappear once the season starts.</P>
