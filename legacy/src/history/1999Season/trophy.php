<H1 ALIGN=Center>League Trophy</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P><IMG SRC="images/greystone2a.jpg" ALIGN=Right></P><P>This is the trophy that we are 
considering for the travelling league trophy.  Each year the League Champion would
get their name enscribed on the trophy.  They also would be allowed to keep the 
trophy for the following year.  At the end of the season the trophy would be awarded
to the new champion.</P>  

<P>We are also considering a smaller trophy or plaque that the
champion would be allowed to keep.  We will probably use 
<A HREF="http://www.arkansas-web.com/trophies/f-football/">Affordable Trophies</A> 
for our awards, so take a look around and see if there is anything that you like.  
Thanks.</P>
