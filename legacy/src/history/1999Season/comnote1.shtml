<P>

With NFL Training Camps beginning this week it is time to begin thinking

about Fantasy Football.  The draft will be held on Saturday, August 14

at 1:00 pm.  I know that with the season starting so late this year,

that this is a very early date for the draft but with some people still

in school and others going on vacation it was hard to work out a closer

date.</P>



<P>

This means that protections will be due on Saturday, August 7.  The

offical draft order will be determined sometime this month.  I am hoping

to determine the draft order this Saturday, July 24, however I would

like to have at least three other teams represented at the drawing.  If

we get a fair sized attendance we can talk about some of the proposals

and hopefully reduce the number that need to be considered at the

draft.</P>



<P>

Finally, the web page has been updated to include this year's fantasy

football schedule and a calendar of events.  Make sure that you take a

look at the calendar to ensure that you don't miss any important dates.

In case you don't remember the web page is
