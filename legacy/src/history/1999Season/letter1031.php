<P>Hi all,</P>



<P>Unfortunatly, I have to go out of town for a training this week.  I'll

be gone from Sunday night till late Friday night.  My access to the web

will be minimal to non-existant.  This means that I will be unable to

update the Fantasy Football web page or even to generate the scores.

Tim is going to handle getting the scores and the newsletter out to

everyone on Tuesday morning.  As for the web page, I will do that when I

get back.  I will also process any transactions that are sent to me at

that time.  If you have any questions or concerns let myself or Tim

know.  Thanks.</P>



<P>Josh</P>
