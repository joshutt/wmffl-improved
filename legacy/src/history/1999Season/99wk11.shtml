WMFFL Newsletter Week #11
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================
Well the transaction deadline is gone.  So we are ready
for the final run at the playoffs.  There are some
important games over the next couple of weeks that will
help determine who gets in the playoffs and for seeding
within the playoffs.  Remember that this is Thanksgiving
week, therefore there is a couple games on Thursday.  So
activations will be due at noon on Thursday.  Due to an
early game time, the deadline will be strictly enforced
this week.

As we mentioned at the beginning of the season we are
planning on purchasing a traveling trophy this year.
The one that I personally like is called the GreyStone
Trophy.  You can see what it looks like at
<A HREF="http://www.arkansas-web.com/trophies/f-football/greystone.shtml">http://www.arkansas-web.com/trophies/f-football/greystone.shtml</A>.
A suggestion was also made to get a smaller trophy that
the champion would keep.  Let me know what you think about
both of these things.

Finally, it appears that there was another game that ended
with two teams negative.  It once again involved the
Barbarians.  and once again the Barbarians lost as a result.
The score of the Barbarians-Werewolves game was -5 to -8.
As stated in the rules the offical score was set to 1 to 0.
