WMFFL Newsletter Week #7
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================

OK, here is the situation. Yesterday I detected an error
in the scoring system that I had entered into the computer,
that caused a descrepancy between the scoring system in the
rules and the scoring system that was being used.  Basiclly,
the difference was that for offensive players only fumbles
lost were counted and not all fumbles.  I corrected the
situation and reran the stats for the entire season.  For
the most part the only changes were some of the final scores.
However, in one case it changed who actually won the game.
Since this was a change from a previous game I was unsure how
to handle it.  In the past when the NFL made a scoring change
it could only effect the result of a game if made before
activations were turned in the following week.  However, this
wasn't an error in the stats.

I appreciate the input that everyone provided on this issue.
What I have decided on is this: a scoring CORRECTION (when
the NFL or Elias Sports Bureau) makes a change to how a play
is scored can affect a previous week's score until
activations are due for the following week, after that time
the uncorrected score is offical.  A scoring ERROR (using
incorrect scoring system or interpreting the scoring system
incorrectly) can be changed up until the end of the seaon or
the following week for playoff games.  The reason for this is
that a scoring error is contrary to the way the actual rules
are written, while a scoring correction is not.  I think that
this is a decision that everyone can live with.

So what does this mean.  Well, it means that some of the
scores for previous weeks have changed.  But most importantly,
it means that last week the original score of the Norsemen vs.
Hempaholics game was 2-1 with the Norsemen winning.  The
correct score is not 1-0 with the Hempaholics winning.
Obviously, this has an impact on the standings, but I'm sure
that everyone can agree that this is the fairest result.
Especially, since proper interpretation of the rules would
have yielded this result to begin with.

I appoligize for the inconvience.  Also, it may be a week or
so before the web page is completly updated with the revised
results.  Today's report does have the corrected information.
