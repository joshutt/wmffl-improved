WMFFL Newsletter Week #14
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================
Well the regular season has ended.  It was a strange year.  The
playoff lineups are set, the Blue Division Champion Norsemen
will take on the Defending League Champion Werewolves and the
Orange Division Champion, Crusaders will meet ZEN.  In the first
ever Toliet Bowl, the Barbarians will face off against the Archers
Who Say Ni.  The loser of that game will be responsible for bringing
beer to the draft, a 12 pack of the Champion's choice beer and a
12-pack of the Offical League Beer.  Which is......  Killian's Red.
It was a close race for the league beer, but a last minute vote made
the difference.  A complete breakdown of the voting is available on
the web page.  Also, remember that this week there are Saturday games
so activations will be due by noon on Saturday (I know it says 11:30
but I'm lenient).  Every team that is still playing should number
their players (1-14).  In the event of a tie the #1s will be compared
then #2, etc.  If you submit your lineup via the web page, just
include the numbering in parenthesis, ie;
  QB:   Washington QB (2)
  RB:   Jim Brown (1)
  RB:   Walter Peyton (3)
  WR:   Art Monk (5)

Good Luck to everyone!!
