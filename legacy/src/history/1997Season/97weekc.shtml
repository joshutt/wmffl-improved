Best Units and Awards
========================
This year, instead of naming All-Blue and All-Orange teams
(which I thought was kind of pointless and a major pain in the ass)
I have decieded to list the best team units at each position and to
announce the awards to teams rather than to fantasy players.

HC  Werewolves        43
QB  Norsemen         183
RB  Werewolves       283
WR  Zen              222
TE  Werewolves        62
K   Norsemen         135
OL  Crusaders        142
DL  Iradicators      135
LB  Zen              244
DB  Crusaders        214

Offense Werewolves   894
Defense Crusaders    482
Total   Werewolves  1311

Best Activator        - Zen
Best General Manager  - Werewolves
Owner of the Year     - Crusaders

Scores for the units are based on actual points scored by activated
players in the Regular Season.  The awards were determined as follows:
Best Activator (which is a stupid name, I wanted to call it best Coach
but I didn't want to confuse it with the head coach position, if
someone can think of a better name please let me know.) is based on how
well the team played the players that it has.  It has no regard for
record and is based purely on points scored vs. possible roster points.
The Best General Manager refers to how well the team gets players onto
its roster.  It has nothing to do with whether the correct players are
activated.  Finally, the Owner of the Year is based on three factors;
1) how well players are activated, 2) how well players are obtained and
3) how well the players perform (record, plus a small bonus for playoff
performance.) For a complete standing of every team see the web page at
