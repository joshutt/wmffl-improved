--  Reminder that on the week of October 23, the activations must be
in by October 19, because Green Bay and Minnesota play a Thursday game.

--  Upcoming Byes:   10/16/94  CHI, DET, GB, MIN, SEA and TB
                     10/23/94  BUF, MIA, NE and NYJ

--  There was an error in last week's score.  The Tsunami activated
both the Arizona OL and K.  Not the San Diego K, as recorded.  This
resulted in 6 more points for the Tsunami.  The final score was
Tsunami 58 - Renegades 57.  NOT Renegades 57 - Tsunami 52.  This weeks
standings reflect that change.

--  This week's record breakers.  Terry McDaniel (RAI-DB), for the
Slayers, had 3 interceptions this week.  The old record was 2, held
by 7 other players.  He also scored 26 points, most by a DB.  Breaking
Eric Turner's record of 25, set earlier this year.

-- TRIVIA:  Who was the 192, Best 1st Round Draft Pick? (It's an award
out version of Rookie of the Year)

-- Last Week's Answer:  In the 3rd week of the 1993 season the Houston
QB unit scored -9 points for the Barbarians.
