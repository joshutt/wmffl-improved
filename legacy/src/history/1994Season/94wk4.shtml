--  If you don't think that we should have head coaches count as points,
beacuse they don't score enough to have an impact on the games.  Look at
today's box scores.  The Tsunami beat the Cloakers by a score of 72 to 69.
Those three points were scored by Marv Levy, the head coach. (Who the
Tsunami fired the next day.)

--  Last Week's record breakers:  New Orleans Kicking unit (Slayers) tied
their own record (10/3/93, Archers) with 2 fieldgoals in the 40 yard range.
  Eric Turner (CLE - DB), from the Archers, became the seventh Defensive
Back to intercept two balls in one game.  He also set a DB point record with
25, the old record was 22 held by Rod Woodson (10/17/93, Barbarians).
  Charles Haley (DAL - DL), from the Renegades, and Bruce Smith (BUF - DL),
from the Cloakers, became the second and third DL to intercept a ball.
Bruce Smith also set a record of 17 points for a DL.
  Terry McDaniel (RAI - DB; Slayers) and Eric Turner (CLE - DB; Archers)
became the tenth and eleventh defensive players to score TD.

--  Reminder that on the week of October 16, the activations must be in by
October 12, because Cleveland and Houston play a Thursday game.

--  Upcoming Byes:   10/2/94     DEN, KC, RAI and SD
                     10/9/94    CIN, CLE, HOU and PIT

-- TRIVIA:  What player holds the distigtion of scoring the most points in
a Fantasy Bowl?
(Hint: He played for the losing team.)

-- Last Week's Answer:  The Barbarians have an all-time record of 14 wins
and 5 losses (not counting this week).  For a percentage of .737.
