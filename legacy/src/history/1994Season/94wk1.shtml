NEWS

-- The Warrior's lineup was not recieved in time for this printing, so their
score is not offical.  Their offical score and any changes in the standings
will be noted in next weeks edition.

-- The Renegades drafted Neil Smith (DL - KC) in the 7th round, but he was
already protected by the Norsemen.  Neil Smith was used for this week, by
both teams, but the Renegades rights to him have been revoked.  The
Renegades have not yet named a replacement.  This does not count as a
transaction.

-- The following teams have paid their entrance fee of $20.  The Slayers,
the Barbarians and the Archers. The other five teams should get their money
in as soon as possible.

-- The Miami QB unit set records for the following things: Total points(40),
Touchdowns for a QB (5), Yards for a QB (481) and Points for a QB (40).

-- Jerry Rice would have broken Micheal Haynes yardage record (182) with his
performace of 192. However teammate Andre Rison scored 193.  That still
wasn't enough to beat Irving Fryars performance of 211.

-- Every single TE record was broken, or tied, this week.  Ben Coates and
Brent Jones tied TD record (2). Ben Coates beat the yardage record (128)
with 161 yards and the points record (13) with 26 points.  Shannon Sharpe
beat the reception record (8) with 9 receptions and would have broken the
points record with 14.

-- The Indianapolis kicker kicked a record 7 extra points.

-- In all 15 records were broken or tied this week.

-- The average score this week was 114 - 75.  Last season it was 78 - 54 on
opening weekend.

-- If this high scoring keeps up, 6 teams will break the total points record
of 1130, set last year by the Barbarians.

-- TRIVIA: What runningback holds the record for most touchdowns on opening
