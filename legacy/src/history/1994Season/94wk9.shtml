--  Remaining Byes:   11/13/94  WAS and IND

--  Rosters are frozen on 11/12/94.  No transactions of any kind after
this date.

--  Many roster violations.  Norsemen - Extra NYG no ARZ.  Barbarians
- Missing 1 RB, Extra SEA, No BUF or HOU.  Warriors - Missing 1 DL, 1
LB, 1 WR, Extra PHI and RAI, No CHI, NYG, DEN, KC or HOU.  Archers -
Missing 1 DB, No SF.  Renegades - Missing 3 LB, 1 WR, Extra SEA, No TB,

consering your teams roster please contact the league office.  (419)
372-5339.  E-mail <joshutt@bgnet.bgsu.edu>

--  This week's record breakers.  Shannon Sharpe, for the Slayers,
tied his and Ben Coates record for TE receptions in a game at 9.  The
Minnesota kicker, for the Warriors, tied a San Diego's record for 4
field goals of less than 40 yards.

--  Note:  Tsunami owner Tim Shoobridge is an idiot because he cut the
QB and K/OL that he signed just two weeks ago and went back to the way
it was before.  In the process he mounted an $8 charge on transactions.
Not counting the 5 free ones.  That's a total of 13 transactions.  He's
the reason we made the transaction rule.  Tim your a moron.

-- TRIVIA:  How many tackles did last year's Defensive Player of the
Year have?

--  The second highest point scorer for the Barbarians last season was
Emmitt Smith with 107 points.
