NEWS

-- A very large mistake was made last week.  The offical score for Andre
Reed was 17 not 22.  This changed the Tsunami's score to 92.  Andre Rison's
score was 26 not 0.  This raised the Norsemen's score to 111.  As a result
the Norsemen beat the Tsunami (111 - 92) not vice versa, as previously
reported (97 - 85).  Any changes in the standings that occured as a result
of this error have been corrected.

-- Last week's poor quality of printing was due to the printer ribbion dying
in mid copy.  This has been corrected and hopefully will not happen again.

-- Three Roster violations were discovered this last week.  Deion Sanders
plays for SF not ATL therefore, Warriors have an extra SF and no ATL.  John
Booty plays for NYG not ARZ therefore Norsemen have an extra NYG and no ARZ.
Darryl Williams (CIN - DB) was drafted by Archers and was picked up last
week as a LB for the Renegades, the Renegades have lost their rights to him,
therefore the Renegades are missing 2 LB, CIN and  RAM players.  The first
two violations must be fixed this week or else 1 transaction point will be
spent untill they are fixed.

-- For those of you that could not read it in last week's edition, my e-mail
address is joshutt@bgnet.bgsu.edu

-- From now on, any trades made after the roster deadline will be included
in the following week's newsletter.

-- TRIVIA:  What franchise has the best all-time record?  (Note: The Legions,
the Pitbulls and the Norsemen are all the same franchise; as are the Zebus
and Cloakers).

-- Last Week's Answer:  In 1992 the Archers opened the season with a five
game winning streak.
