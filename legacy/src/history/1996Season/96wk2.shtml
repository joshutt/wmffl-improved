NOTICE of Scoring Correction From Week 1
============================================================
  The National Football League and Elias Sports Bureau have
issued a change of statistics notice from week 1.  The play
in question occured in the Miami vs. New England Game.  Miami
had the ball on New England's 17 yard line.  Dan Marino threw
a pass to Stanley Pritchett.  Pritchett caught the ball and
ran to the 2 yard line, where he fumbled.  Scott Mitchell
picked the ball up, on the 1 yard line and scored a touchdown.
  Originally the NFL and the ESB scored the play as follows:
- Marino 15 yard pass to Pritchett
- Pritchett 1 catch for 15 yards and a fumble
- Mitchell a fumble recovery, 1 yard rushing and a rushing TD

The scoring has been changed!!  It should no read:
- Marino 17 yard touchdown pass
- Pritchett 1 catch for 15 yards and a fumble
- Mitchell a fumble recovery, 0 catches for 2 yards and a
           recieving TD

Essentially, they have changed the touchdown from a rushing TD,
to a passing TD.  I don't understand why and I don't necessarly
agree with it.  But, that is what the NFL and ESB are scoring
it as, so that is what we will score it as.  This does not
change the results of last week's games, however it does change
the scores slightly.  These changes are reflected in this week's
standings.
