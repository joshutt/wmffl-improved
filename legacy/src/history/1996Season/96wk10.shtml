Notes From the Commissioner
===============================
 Tie Breakers
Some people have asked to be reminded on what the procedures for
tie-breaking are, should two teams end up with the same record.  Here
they are:
  1. Head-to-Head record
  2. Total Points scored
  3. Total Points in Head-To-Head Games
  4. Average Points by Head Coach
  5. Fantsy Ranking
  6. Historical Tendancy
There has never been a tie that was not broken by the 2nd tie-breaker,
so numbers 3 through 6 are pretty much irrelevant, but just in case.

 BYES
There are no More NFL Byes!!!  Yeah!!!
The remaining WMFFL Byes are as follows:
Week 11    Norsemen
Week 12    Archers Who Say Ni
Week 13    Warriors
Week 14    Fighting Squirrels

 Transactions
This is the last week to make transactions.  If you want to make a
change to your team, for the streach run, you must do so by Sunday.

 Record Performamces
In week 9, Chris Doleman of the Fighting Squirrels became the eighth
Defensive Linemen to get an interception.

**Reminder**  It is your right and duty as an American to vote.  So if
you haven't done so, take five minutes and let your voice be
