Notes From the Commissioner
===========================
 From now on, this segment will be included in the Weekly report, to
inform members of the league of important dates and other vital
information.
 Could everyone do me a favor.  Anytime you see or talk to Bobby or
Hall bug them about paying their entry fee.  Bobby currently owes
$41.82 (and that's after his current winnings have been taken out) and
Jon still owes $8.19 (again after winnings are deducted).  At the end
of the season, nobody will get their money until everything is paid.
 Halfway through the season, it seems that more people are actively
involved with their teams.  I am pleased to see this encouraging
activity.  Remember this is your league, any ideas that you have to
make the league, the weekly reports or the web pages better are
greatly appreciated.
