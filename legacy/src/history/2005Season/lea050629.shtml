<P>
<I>June 29, 2005</I> - 
After reviewing everyone's options for when to hold the draft, the
unanimous favorite was Saturday, August 20th.  Everyone said they would be able
to make it that day.  So I'm expecting a very strong turnout.  The draft will most
likely be held at Mike's house, but that does need to be confirmed.  Directions 
will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>As a result of the draft on the 20th, protections will be due at 11:59 pm on
August 14th.  Also, the final draft order will be determined no later than
August 7th, mostly likely it'll be done before the end of July.
