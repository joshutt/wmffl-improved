<p>All of the below depends on the assumption that existing player scores will
hold up.  As a result, the Sacks on the Beach have defeated the Bug Stompers,
10-4.  In addition the Crusaders have defeated the Whiskey Tango by at least 2
although the final margin is still to be determined.  (Only defensive players
left, defensive can't get negative points, thus the Crusaders can't lose).</p>

<p>The Crusaders-Whiskey Tango game still has Darren Howard (DL-NO) and 
Deangelo Hall (DB-ATL) left to play for the Crusaders.  The MeggaMen hold a 10
point lead vs the Rednecks, with Warrick Dunn (RB-ATL) left for the Rednecks
and Rod Coleman (DL-ATL) and Keith Brooking (LB-ATL) for the MeggaMen.  The 
Werewolves are tied with the Norsemen, 0-0 (true).  The Werewolves have Michael
Vick (QB-ATL), Alge Crumpler (TE-ATL) and Atlanta OL still to play.</p>
