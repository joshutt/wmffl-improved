<H1 ALIGN=Center>New Bug Stompers Owner</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P>
<I>July 28, 2005</I> - 
Our search to find a new owner for the Bug Stompers has been completed.  Ayrik Moran has agreed to take over the team, pending league approval.  Many of you already know Ayrik, but for those who don't; Ayrik is Tim's brother-in-law and grew up in the house next door to Byron.  </p>

<p>Ayrik comes in with a confidence unfitting the team he is inheriting, saying "I'm confident that I will dominate your league."  He has agreed to pay both the 2005 and 2006 entry fee, to ensure that he stays around for at least two years.   "I'll be spending all your prize money on chicken wings and a foot massage after I'm crowned Victor. Believe it." he said.  </p>

<p>This will all become official once the league approves.  Since I would like to get the approval done and move on to the other proposals, as well as determine draft order and all that other stuff, I'll ask everyone to quickly go to the web page, select "Voting Ballot" and vote on Ayrik's approval.  Hopefully, we can get that done one way or another within the next couple of days.  Thanks.  </p>
