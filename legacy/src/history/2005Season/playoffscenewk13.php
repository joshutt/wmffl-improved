<p>Due to the overwhelming complexity of the playoff picture this year, I did not factor in the possibility of ties when figuring out the playoffs (it's the difference of 256 possible outcomes vs 6,561).  They are, however included in the Toliet Bowl list.</p>

<p>
<h4>Burgandy Division Championship</h4>
<font size="-2">Due to extreme complexity possible ties are not factored into the possibilities listed here.</font>
<ul>
<li><b>Bug Stompers</b> - Can win division with win vs Sacks on the Beach and Werewolves losing one of their remaining games</li>
<li><b>Sacks on the Beach</b> - Will win division with wins vs Werewolves and Bug Stompers</li>
<li><b>Werewolves</b> - Will win division with wins vs Sacks on the Beach and Norsemen and the Bug Stompers lose one of their remaining games</li>
<li>If the Werewolves and the Bug Stompers win out, then there will be a two way point differential tie breaker between them.  (The Werewolves currently have a +29 edge, a tie there goes to Bug Stompers on Head-to-head point differential)</li>
<li>If the Werewolves beat the Sacks on the Beach, but lose to the Norsemen and the Sacks on the Beach beat the Bug Stompers, then there will be a two way point differential tie breaker between them, unless the Bug Stompers also beat the Crusaders which would make it a 3 way tie breaker.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Gold Division Championship</h4>
<font size="-2">Due to extreme complexity possible ties are not factored into the possibilities listed here.</font>
<ul>
<li><b>Crusaders</b> - Wins division with win vs Whiskey Tango and ONE of the following:
    <ul><li>win vs Bug Stompers</li>
    <li>Rednecks beat Whiskey Tango and MeggaMen lose at least one</li></ul></li>
<li><b>MeggaMen</b> - Wins division if ALL of the following occur:
    <ul><li>Win vs Gallic Warriors and Rednecks</li>
    <li>Rednecks beat Whiskey Tango</li>
    <li>Bug Stompers beat Crusaders</li>
    <li>Crusaders beat Whiskey Tango</li></ul>
    Can also force a point differential tie breaker with Whiskey Tango if they beat both Gallic Warriors and Rednecks, the Crusaders lose to Bug Stompers and the Whiskey Tango win exactly one remaining game.</li>
<li><b>Whiskey Tango</b> - wins division with with either of the following:
    <ul><li>win vs Crusaders</li>
    <li>win vs Rednecks and Crusaders lose to Bug Stompers</li></ul>
    UNLESS they lose the other game and the MeggaMen win both their games then a Whiskey Tango-MeggaMen point differential tie breaker will result.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wild Card</h4>
What?  Are you suicidal?  Isn't the above complicated enough for you?  Your head would explode if I even attempted to go into Wild Card possibilities.  If you're in that group of six teams, just win both your games and you'll be ok.

<h4>Burgandy Division Toliet Bowl</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Lindbergh Baby Casserole</b> - will go to Toliet Bowl with any of the following: <ul>
    <li>lose or tie Norsemen</li>
    <li>lose to Gallic Warriors</li>
    <li>Norsemen beat Werewolves</li>
    <li>tie Gallic Warriors and Norsemen tie Werewolves</li>
    </ul></li>
<li><b>Norsemen</b> - can still go to Toliet Bowl with a loss to Lindbergh Baby Casserole and one of the following: <ul>
    <li>lose to Werewolves and LBC win or tie Gallic Warriors</li>
    <li>tie Werewolves and LBC beat Gallic Warriors</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Gold Division Toliet Bowl</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Gallic Warriors</b> - can still go to Toliet Bowl if they lose both remaining games and the Rednecks win both of thier games</li>
<li><b>Rednecks</b> - will go to Toliet Bowl if they lose or tie one remaining game or Gallic Warriors win or tie one remaining game</li>
</ul>
