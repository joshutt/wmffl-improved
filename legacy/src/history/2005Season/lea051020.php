<I>October 20, 2005</I> - 

Due to Hurricane Wilma the NFL has decided to move the game between the 
Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins to Friday, October 21st at 7:00pm.
That means that activations will be due at that time. </p>

<p>Obviously, this is a unexpected event, but is consistant with what we
have done in the past when game times were moved.  The tough part this time
is that it is such sort notice.  Again, activations are due by FRIDAY at 7:00pm. Sorry for the inconvenance</p>
