<P>
    Protections will be based on a point system. Every
    team will be allocated 65 points with which to protect players. Each player
    will be worth a number of points based on position and years he has been
    protected. The base position points are as follows:
<TABLE BORDER=1>

        <TD>QB</TD>
        <TD>RB</TD>
        <TD>WR</TD>

<P>Adding the postion cost and adjustment factor together will give you
    a player's protection cost. As many players as desired may be protected,
    so long as a team does not exceed their point limit. Points may be traded.
    Any points not used on protections will become transaction points. There
    will be no free transaction points this year.</P>

<P>Below is a list of number of years that players have been protected.
    If a player does not appear on this list, their adjustment factor will
    be 0. By taking the player's position and the number below you should
    be able to find out how much each player will cost to protect.</P>
