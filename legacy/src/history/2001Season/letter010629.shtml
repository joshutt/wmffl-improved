<H1 ALIGN=Center>Letter from the Commissioner</H1>
<H5 ALIGN=Center><I>June 29, 2001</I></H5>
<HR size = "1">

<P>Hello All,</P>

<P>There is one month until football training camp begins, so it is time to
start thinking about fantasy football.  Unfortunatly, I have been extremely
lazy in terms of football this off-season and have let a number of things slip
that should not have.  The most notable of these are the year end awards and
paying out of winnings.  So I'm going to quickly summarize these now, for more
details take a look at the web site (
<A HREF="/index.shtml">http://www.wmffl.com</A>).</P>

</TABLE>
Because it is so late in the year, I will automaticly credit any balances of
less than $50.00 towards the 2001 entry fee.  The balances that are over $50
will be paid out for the portion over $50.  If you want a breakdown of why
your balance is what it is, see the
<A HREF="/history/2000Season/money.shtml">web site</A>.</P>

<P>Ok, that should take care of all the remaining issues from last year.  So
lets take a look ahead.  The draft is preliminarly set for August 11 (in
accordance with the rules), however because the NFL season doesn't start
until September 9th, I am recommending moving the draft date to August 25.
Please let me know which date would be better for you, also anyone that is
considering not playing this year, please let me know that as well.  If
anyone has a rule change proposal that they would like to make, there is a
link on the web site for submissions.  Finally, I have looked through last
years results and have determined the draft weight for each team.</P>
