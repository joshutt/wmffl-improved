<H1 ALIGN=Center>ZEN wheel and deal for "rebuilding year"</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P><I>Elephant Butte, NM </I>-- It has been a busy night for ZEN Owner, GM, and
Director of Chearleading Operations, Warren Allen.  In the busiest
single day of the franchises history, two seperate deals were made in
what is being called a bold move to revitalize the aging and injured
roster.</P>

<P>The first of two deals yet to be confirmed by league HQ involved sending
starting RB Fred Taylor, Denver Kickers, and a fourth round draft spot
to the newly renamed War Eagles in exchange for RB Duce Staley,
Tennessee Kickers, a first round draft spot, and draft position priority.</P>

<P>The second deal sent WR Jimmy Smith to the Hempaholics in return for the
Denver QB unit and an 8th round draft spot.  Both deals sent
injury-prone players away in favour of revamping the team with
potentially high draft picks.</P>

<P>"We made these deals so we could keep both of our start Linebackers in
camp and get rid of two fragile players and hopefully pull in some young
talent," says Allen.  "Also, I'm sick of them bitching about the
location of training camp."
