<P>In the wake of the Pentagon and World Trade Center Bombings, the NFL
cancelled all week 2 games.  They have since decided that these games
would be made up the weekend of January 5-6.  Since the full schedule will
be played, the WMFFL will also play a full schedule.</P>

<P>All games from week 2 will be played week 3 and all other games will
be pushed back one week.  This means that the playoffs will begin December 22-23.
The revised schedule is now <A HREF="\history\2001Season\schedule.shtml">available</A>.</P>

<P>It should also be noted that due to these events and the moving of the
baseball schedule, the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys have moved their
game scheduled from October 21 to October 7.  Both teams were scheduled for
a bye on October 7 (Week 5) that they will have on October 21 (Week 7) instead.
</P>
