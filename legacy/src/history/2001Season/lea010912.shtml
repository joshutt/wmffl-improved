<P>America got bombed with commercial airplanes yesterday. Have you heard?</P>

<P>Innocent people died in DC and NYC.</P>

<P>Anyone see the pictures of the people jumping? How about the total collapse of that wing of the Pentagon?</P>

<P>All for what? Does anyone really know?</P>

<P>I have carpet people coming today to install a runner on my stairs. They are from Egypt. My neighbors across the street are Palestinian (my husband is Jewish). The guy who books bands where my band plays once a month is from Afghanistan, so are the guys who work behind the bar. I never thought much about it until yesterday.</P>

<P>They just busted a group of "Bin Lauden supporters" in a housing development right near my work.</P>

<P>TV shows, newspapers, radio shows - all talk of devastation and death.</P>

<P>In DC? Are they sure? I thought we were safe here, this is where the President lives.</P>

<P>I drive by the Pentagon every day - it's 10 minutes from my house.</P>

<P>TEN MINUTES.</P>

<P>I know people who were in NYC and the Pentagon yesterday.</P>

<P>This was not just war on the US - this was war on the world. I hope that all of you, your friends and your family, in America and around the world, will ban together as one army to fight this kind of terror.</P>

<P>Last night, watching the singing of "God Bless America" I was reminded of Whooville- from the popular Christmas story - The Grinch. You all remember that story, right?</P>

<P>The Grinch does whatever he can to take away Christmas from Whooville. But even after he's taken away all of their lights, their trees, their food and their gifts - they still join together to sing about the spirit of Christmas.</P>

<P>And so should all Americans today and from now on. We will not allow our spirit of Freedom to suffer at the hands of anyone.</P>

<P>We will continue to sing.</P>

<P>God Bless America.</P>
