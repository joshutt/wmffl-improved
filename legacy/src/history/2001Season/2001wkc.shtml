=======================================================
Congratulations to the Crusaders who win their third
Championship, joining the Barbarians and Norsemen as the
other three time winners.  The game MVP went to the
Dallas Offensive Line because of thier 12 point
performance.  The full box score for the game is listed
below the awards.

As an additional reminder we are converting from team
QBs to individual QBs over the next month.  So everyone
needs to send in which individual player thier team QB
represents.  (ie, San Fran QB is Jeff Garcia, etc).
Failure to do so sill result in that player being the
"logical" choice, which isn't necessarly who you
actually want (ie, ATL would be Cris Chandler not Michael
Vick)
