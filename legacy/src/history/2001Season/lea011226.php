<H1 ALIGN=Center>2001 Award Nominees</H1>
<H5 ALIGN=Center><I>December 26, 2001</I></H5>
<HR size = "1">

<P>I have recieved a number of nominations for each of the awards.  While all
of them were good nominations (well, maybe only most of them were), I did have 
to narrow the field down to three for each category.  So for each award, I have
included three nominees.  I would appreciate it if everyone could vote for one
in each category and send your votes to me by Sunday.  The winners will be 
announced next week.  Thanks for everyone that submitted thier ideas.
