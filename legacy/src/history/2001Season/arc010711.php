<HR size = "1">

<P><I>(July 11, 2001)</I> - After nine years of of running the Archers Who Say Ni
(originally, Archers), Mike Emrey decided on Tuesday to relinguish control
of the team.  He cited his recent move to Minnesota and his intentions on doing
extensive travelling in the comming months as reasons.  He did leave open the
possiblity of a future return.</P>

<P>Ownership of the team was immediatly offered to Jim Bishop, who accepted
the offer on Wednesday morning.  Jim has previous fantasy football experience
in the <A HREF="http://www.lucidphoenix.com/flof/">FLOF</A> and is currently
a primary developer on a major online fantasy football system.  Unfortunatly,
Jim is a New York Giants fan, but everyone has flaws and this should not be
held against him.  Jim is looking forward to turning this franchise around.
This is the 4th time that a franchise has changed ownership and the first
since 1996.</P>

<P>The Archers Who Say Ni are one of the four original teams in the WMFFL
(Crusaders/Renegades, Norsemen/Pitbulls/Legion of Byron and Werewolves/Slayers)
and have amassed a 39-85 all-time record.  They finished the 1992 season with
a 7-5 record good enough for thier only playoff appearance, a Championship Game
loss to the Renegades, 22-19.  The following year they finished 7-7 and missed
the playoffs on tiebreakers.  However, since 1993 they have struggled to get
back in contention and have not had a winning season since.  In 1999 they hit
a low point when they lost the inaugural Toliet Bowl and posted a 10 game
losing streak, second only to a 12 game streak they set in 1994.</P>
