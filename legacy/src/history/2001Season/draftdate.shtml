<H1 ALIGN=Center>Draft Date Set For August 25th</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P>After reviewing everyone's draft day requests (except for Byron, but we all
know that he can't make it whatever day we schedule it anyways) it is clear
that the best day for the draft is Saturday, August 25.  The draft will be
held at 1:00 at Hall's apartment.  As we get closer to the draft, Hall will
give everyone directions.</P>

<P>As a result of the draft being on the 25th, protections will be due no
later than Saturday, August 18.  The draft order will be determined and
published by Saturday, August 11th.</P>

<B>Josh <BR>
Commissioner WMFFL</B></P>
