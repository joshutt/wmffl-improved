<P><I>(July 16, 2001) Gnome - (AP):</I></P>

<P>In a underhanded move today, Jim Bishop, the new
owner of the Archer Who Say Ni, packed up his team and relocated to Gnome
Alaska. Bishop stated that the added revenue generated from a Stadium naming
deal and luxury suites would be instrumental in turning around the franchise.
Bishop also changed the team name and logo. "You gotta start some where"
Bishop said. "The Archers had a reputation as a door mat. We want our War
Eagle to strike fear into the hearts of our opposition." Former Head Coach
Wade Phillips was left in his office with a super wedgie and not retained by
the new owner. New coach _Andy Ried_, formerly of the Philadelphia Eagles was
brought on as the new coach. Reid was unavailable for comment.
