WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #13
==============================
Week 13 has setup an exciting final week of the season.  No team has 
been eliminated from post-season play, only three have clilnched 
positions.  Of the other 7 teams, 5 are vying for a playoff spot and 
2 are trying to avoid the Toliet Bowl.

With their 63-18 victory over the Green Wave, the Crusaders have 
clinched their 6th division title in the last 8 years.  They are also
the first franchise to reach 100 all-time franchise victories.  On the
other side, the Norsemen clinched a Toliet Bowl berth with a 39-13
loss to the Freezer Burn.

The MeggaMen remain in contention with their 29-0 blanking of the 
Illuminati.  This is their first victory over the Illuminati in the 
last four meetings.  The Rednecks set a league record with their third
tie of the season, this time to the Whiskey Tango 0-0.  This also 
extends their winless streak to 6 games.  Finally, the Werewolves 
failed to claim a playoff spot, falling to the War Eagles 66-56.
