WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #10
==============================
All kinds of crazy illegal activations this week, thankfully there are
no more byes.  The Whiskey Tango had 4 bye week activations, thats 8 
penalty points and $4.  The Crusaders also had a bye week activation,
2 pts and $1.  Finally, the Norsemen activated a player that was not 
on their roster.  This is also a 2 point penalty and a $1 fine.  

The War Eagles lose their first game of the season, falling 67-34 to 
the Norsemen.  This ends the War Eagles unbeaten streak at 9 games, 
the fourth longest such streak in league history (and tied for third 
longest regular season streak).  This is also the 98th franchise 
victory by the Norsemen.  The Crusaders also have 98 franchise 
victories with their win over the MeggaMen, 6-0.  This is the first 
time the Crusaders have defeated the MeggaMen since 2001.

The Green Wave surge back to pick up thier first win of the season, 
downing the Rednecks 33-11.  This ends the league's longest winless 
streak at 14 games.  The Whiskey Tango drop another game, as their 
playoff hopes fade.  They are now winless in seven straight.  Finally,
in a battle of traditional rivals, the Illuminati destroy the 
Werewolves 67-24.  The Illuminati have now won 5 of the last 6 regular
season games vs the Werewolves.
