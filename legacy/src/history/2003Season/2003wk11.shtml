WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #11
==============================
The playoff race is very tight this year.  There are 7 teams within 2
games of each other and three playoff positions fall within that 
range.  In the Burgandy division there is only a 1.5 game seperation 
between 2nd place and the Toliet Bowl.  Because of how close it is 
and because of the effect ties have had, it is virtually impossible 
to generate a playoff possiblities matrix.  The only thing that is 
certain is that the War Eagles have clinched a playoff berth, for the
first time in 11 years.  With another win or tie or both a Illuminati
and Werewolves loss or tie, the War Eagles will clinch their first 
ever division title.

The War Eagles clearly reaffirmed their position as the team to beat 
with a 55-18 victory over the Rednecks.  This is only the second time
the War Eagles have defeated the Rednecks since 1995.  The Whiskey 
Tango end their 7 game winless streak with a victory over the MeggaMen.
The Green Wave kicked the shit out of the Werewolves, for their second
straight victory.  Damn the Werewolves suck, I have no clue how they 
won six games this season.  They have now lost three straight games,
tied for an all-time franchise high in the regular season.  

The Crusaders moved to within 1 game of franchise win number 100, by 
defeating the Norsemen 50-21.  The Crusaders lead that all-time series
14-11-1.  The Freezer Burn made in clear they are still in the playoff
race, by defeating the Illuminati 34-10.
