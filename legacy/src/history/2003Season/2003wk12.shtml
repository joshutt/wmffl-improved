WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #12
==============================
Don't forget that there are games on Thanksgiving.  Activations are 
due by Noon that day.  Also, a number of those lingering rule 
proposals passed this week.  Proposals 2003.2, 2003.3b and 2003.6 all
passed.  Those deal with late payment penalties, fines for not 
attending the draft and offensive fumble points.  All those rules will
take effect at the completion of the season.  Proposal 2003.4, dealing
with the Toliet Bowl Loser's draft pick, still does not have enough 
votes to be passed or rejected.


With their win this week vs the Freezer Burn the War Eagles have 
clinched thier first division title in the franchise's 12 year 
history.  In other key games with playoff implications, the Illuminati
defeat the Crusaders and the Werewolves are victorious vs the Rednecks.
Both the Illuminati and Werewolves can now clinch a wild card berth 
with another win.  The Crusaders continue to lead the Gold Division 
over the Rednecks by half a game, they play each other the final week 
of the season.  With thier win vs the Norsemen, the MeggaMen also 
remain alive in the Gold Division.  Finally, the Green Wave continue 
thier surge to avoid the Toliet Bowl, defeating the Whiskey Tango 31-0.
Both teams are now tied at 3-8-1 and the Green Wave win the tiebreaker.
