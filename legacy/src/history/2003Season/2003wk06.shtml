WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #6
=============================
The Crusaders and Green Wave each activated players on a bye.  As a
reward they each receive a 2 point penalty and a $1 fine.

The two undefeated teams remain so, after tying 0-0.  This breaks the
War Eagles' 5 game winning streak, tied for a franchise high.  But
sets a franchise mark with 6 straight unbeaten games.  At the same
time, the Rednecks extend their unbeaten streak to 9 games, now the
third longest in league history.  This is the first tie in War Eagles
team history, every team has now had at least one tie.

The Freezer Burn picked up a 14-0 victory over the Green Wave.  The
Green Wave now have an 11 game losing streak, the second longest ever.
A loss next week will tie the league record.  The Crusaders pickup a
win over Whiskey Tango, 32-7.  This ties the all-time series between
these clubs at 11-11.  The Illuminati pickup their third shutout of
the season, defeating the MeggaMen for the third straight time.  The
Werewolves sweep the season series from the Norsemen for the first
time in 10 seasons. This is only the ninth time the Werewolves have
beaten the Norsemen in their 27 meetings.
