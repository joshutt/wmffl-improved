WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #5
=============================
The Rednecks win another close battle.  This time defeating the 
Illuminati for the first time since 1999.  The Rednecks are now 
unbeaten in their last 8 games, a streak that ties them for the third
longest in league history.  The War Eagles also remained undefeated 
by picking up a 36-23 victory over the Crusaders.  Only the second 
time they've beaten the Crusaders since 1995.  These two undefeated 
teams meet next week.  On the other side of streaks, the Green Wave 
fall to the Norsemen, extending their losing streak to 10 games, tied
for second longest in league history.  The MeggaMen defeated the 
Freezer Burn 51-24 to get back to .500 on the season.  Finally, the 
Werewolves blanked the Whiskey Tango, 24-0.  The ninth time the 
Werewolves have defeated them in their last 11 meetings.
