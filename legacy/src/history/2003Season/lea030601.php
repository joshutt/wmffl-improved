<I>June 1, 2003</I> - After a one year hiatus, Warren Allen returned to the 
WMFFL today, taking over the helm of the Barbarians.  With hopes of restoring
the franchise to its once glorious history.  The league approved the decision,
by a vote of 6-0, with 3 No Votes (the Barbarians were not eligible to vote). 
All ownership privileges are immediatly transfer to Warren.</P>

<P>When asked to comment on the decision, Warren responed "This is a great day
for the Barbarians, the recent trends will be reversed and this once proud
franchise will become successful again.  I promise to return to the postseason,
even if it means making the Toliet Bowl."  The former owner, Keppy Plitt was
unavailable for comment, it's believed he's on a speaking tour regarding "The
Idiocy and Stupidity of Jaques Chiraq and the French People, and It's 
Detrimental Effect on Freedom and Liberty of the Western Civilization in the
21st Century."</P>

<P>After entering the league in 1993, the Barbarians immediatly went on a tear 
winning four straight Division Titles and the Championship three straight years.
After the transfer of ownership from Bobby Rainey to Keppy Plitt, the team
took a sudden downward spiral, finishing last, or tied for last the next four
years.</P>

<P>Warren was the owner of the Warriors/ZEN from 1993 through the 2001 season.  He lead the team to five playoff appearence and two championship games.  In
