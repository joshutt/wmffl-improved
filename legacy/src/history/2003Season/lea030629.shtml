<H1 ALIGN=Center>Draft Date Announced (Only a week late)</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P><I>June 29, 2003</I> - After reviewing the dates that everyone could and 
could not attend the draft, there was one date that really stood out.  So the 
draft will be held on Sunday, August 24th.  This is the same weekend as the
original date and nobody claimed that they couldn't make that day, so I expect
to see everyone there.  It also works out nicely because all the week 3 
training camp games will be over, so most roster slots will be pretty well 
known.  It also occurs 10 days before the start of the season, so there is not
the long lag that we have in some years.  The exact time and location are yet 
to be determined, and will be announced sometime in July.</P>
