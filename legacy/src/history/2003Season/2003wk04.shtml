WMFFL Scores for 2003 Week #4
=============================
The Whiskey Tango activated Tiki Barber and Zach Thomas, both who
were on byes.  Thus they receive a $2 fine and a 4 point penalty.
Also the Illuminati still have not paid thier entry fee and currently
owe $11.80.

The War Eagles remain undefeated with a 26-0 victory over the Green
Wave.  This extends the Green Wave's franchise high losing streak to
9 games, the third longest in league history. It also sets-up the
unbelievable stat of the Green Wave having been shut-out in 5 of
their last 7 games.  The Norsemen defeated the Crusaders in an
offensive shootout, 93-70.  The Norsemen's 118 offensive points is
believed to be the highest offensive score in league history.  Both
teams now have 94 all-time franchise victories.  The Illuminati
staged a Monday night, Brett Favre comeback to edge the Freezer Burn,
8-6.  For the second week in a row the Rednecks win a close game,
where the other team activated players on byes.  They extend their
unbeaten streak to 7 games, with a 28-24 victory.  Finally, the
Werewolves beat the MeggaMen in a rematch of last year's Championship.
This was the first time the Werewolves have defeated the MeggaMen in
a regular season game.
