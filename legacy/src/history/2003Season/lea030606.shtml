<H1 ALIGN=Center>Draft Date and Voting Issues</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P>
<I>June 6, 2003</I> - It has come to my attention that one of the owners will 
be unable to make the draft on August, 23rd.  As a result I'm checking to see 
if there is a better date, when everyone can make it.  Please log onto the site
and select whatever dates you will not be able to attend.  I'll make the 
announcement as to the date on June 20th.</P>

<P>Also, I've been urged not to convert any 'No Votes' to 'Abstains' on voting
issues, so I'm going to let issue 2003.1 remain on the ballot until it is 
decided one way or another.  (Crusaders, Barbarians and Freezer Burn are the 
teams that haven't voted).</P>

<P>At the same time, since there has been little recent discussion on issue 
2003.4 and 5 (Toliet Bowl Draft picks and Champion Draft picks), I'm going to
place them on the ballot for voting as well.  So you can go ahead and vote on 
those issues.  Finally, I'm going to open up 2003.3a and 2003.3b for formal 
discussion.  These deal with penalties for failing to attend to the draft.</P>
