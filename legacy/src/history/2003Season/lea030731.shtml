<H1 ALIGN=Center>Draft Information</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P><I>July 31, 2003</I> - Thought I'd give everyone a quick update on the 
draft.  It will be held on Sunday, August 24th at 1:00 at Mike Atlas'.  Mike 
lives in Springfield, I'll leave the directions up to him.  I've had at least 
one request to do the draft via IM, so I think that's an option that will be 
available again this year.</P>

<P>As a result of the draft being the 24th, protections will be due by
midnight on August 17th.  The web pages to do protections should be up within
the next couple of days.  The draft order will be determined no later than the
10th.  Since I got so much flak last year about the way I did the draft order,
I'm soliciting ideas on a fair way to do the drawing.  If no one comes up with 
anything, I'll use the same method I did last year.</P>

<P>Remember that the $50 entry fee is due at the time of the draft.  This of 
course, is minus whatever you won last year, if you chose to roll the amount 
over.  For those of you wishing to pay ahead of time you may do so via PayPal 
(use josh@*****.com) or send a check to:</P>

<P>I think that's all for now.  See everyone in a few weeks.</P>

<P>Josh</P>
