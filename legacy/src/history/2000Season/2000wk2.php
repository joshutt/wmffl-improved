WMFFL Newsletter Week #2
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================
A new feature has been added to the web page this week.
Since and increased number of teams are using the
leauge software, there will be a direct link to the
most current league file on the home page.  Instead of
downloading a ZIP file, unzipping it then opening it in
the Owner's Assistant, you can now download the .ff0
file directly.  Just click the link and download it
like you would any other file.  I have also created a
batch file on my machine, so that the file can be
updated quickly.  This means that I will be able to
update the league file much more frequently.  You can
check the date and time on the home page to see if you
have the most recent version.

As a side note, when you submit your activations via the
web page, please make sure that you remember to select
your team from the drop down box.  I have recieved a
couple of activations that did not have anything
selected and I had to try and figure out who it was from.
Thanks.
