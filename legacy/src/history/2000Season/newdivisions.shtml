<H1 ALIGN=Center>WMFFL Realignment</H1>
<HR size = "1">

<P>According to the WMFFL rules we must realign the divisions every two years.
The division champions since the last realignment, will remain in the division
they are in and all other teams will be considered for movement.  The new divisions
will be based on a win/loss differential over two years.</P>

<P>Because the Werewolves won the Blue Division in 1998 and the Norsemen won in 1999,
both of those teams will remain in the Blue Division.  The Crusaders won the Orange
Division in both 1998 and 1999.  The other 5 teams could be moved into either divison.
Below is a list of each team's won/loss differential over the past two years.</P>

</TABLE></P>

<P>Given these facts there are two division alignments that yield a game differential
of 0.  Both options place the Werewolves, Norsemen and Archers Who Say Ni in the 
Blue Division and the Crusaders, Barbarians and ZEN in the Orange Division.  The 
Green Wave and the Hempaholics could go into either division based on one year game
differential.</P>

<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%>
<TR><TH>One-Year differential</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Archers Who Say Ni</TD><TD>-8</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Barbarians</TD><TD>-2</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Crusaders</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Green Wave</TD><TD>-4</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Hempaholics</TD><TD>-2</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Norsemen</TD><TD>8</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Werewolves</TD><TD>0</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ZEN</TD><TD>4</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>Given these numbers, the game differential before placing the Hempaholics or Green
Wave is; Blue Division=0, Orange Division=+6.  By placing the Hempaholics in the 
Blue Division the difference is -2/+2, the Green Wave would make it -4/+4.  Thus the 
Hempaholics will be placed in the Blue Division and the Green Wave in the Orange.  
Below is a summary of the offical division alignments for 2000 and 2001.
