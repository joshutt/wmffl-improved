<H1 ALIGN=Center>Draft Day</H1>
<H5 ALIGN=Center><I>July 27, 2000</I></H5>
<HR size = "1">

<P>Hello all,<BR>
Thought I would give everyone an update on the expansion draft issue and the
draft date.  As was previously announced, the draft will be held on Saturday,
August 12.  It will be at 1:00pm at Warren's.  If you don't know directions
to Warren's let me or Warren know.  That means that protections will be due
on August 5.  Which brings up the issue of the expansion draft.</P>

<P>The option that the people seem to like best, and is the fairest, is to
have the existing teams protect 6 players at protection time.  On draft day
the expansion teams will pick one player per position from unprotected roster
players.  Once a team loses a player they may re-protect two players, if they
have the protections to use on them.  The expansion teams will also recieve
supplemental draft picks at the end of the 1st and 2nd rounds.  This is the
plan we are going to go with, unless I hear massive opposition to it in the
next couple of days.</P>

<P>Finally, the optional meeting to determine the draft order has been
unattended for the past couple of years, so this Saturday I will generate
the draft order based on the new weight rules.  The expansion teams will
recieve a weight of 1 plus the highest weight in the league.</P>

<P><B>SUMMARY:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Draft August 12 at 1:00 at Warren's
<LI>Protections due August 5th, (1 at each position plus 1 other, but only
6 maybe used by August 5th).
<LI>Draft order will be announced this weekend
</UL></P>

<P>As usual, if anything in this email is unclear let me know and I'll try
and clear it up.  That's all for now.</P>

<P>
<B>Josh <BR>
Commissioner WMFFL</B></P>
