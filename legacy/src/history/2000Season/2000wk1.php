WMFFL Newsletter Week #1
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================
Both the Archers Who Say Ni and the Unnammed Expansion
Team failed to submit lineups for this week.  As
everyone knows, when I lineup is not submitted the
previous week's lineup is used.  However, this is week
1 and there is no previous week, this occurance is
unprecedented.  So the ruling is this; any players
still on the roster from the last activations of last
year will be activated any unfilled spots will be left
empty.  Therefore, the Archer Who Say Ni were able to
field a team of 10 players plus a head coach.  The
Unnamed Team was unable to field a team at all.  Of
course, both of these teams were fined $1 for fielding
illegal lineups.

The ZEN and Norsemen were also fined $1 each for
activating players on a bye.

The following teams still owe thier entry fee:
   ZEN             $55.11
   Barbarians      $47.47
   Unnamed Team    $57.00
