<H1 ALIGN=Center>Letter from the Commissioner</H1>
<H5 ALIGN=Center><I>October 10, 2000</I></H5>
<HR size = "1">

<P>There were a couple of scoring discrepancies this week, so I though that
would just clear everything up.  First of all, I encourage you to review the
scores for your game.  Do NOT ASSUME that the stats are correct.  If you
find any scores that don't look right or you have a question about, please
ask me.  I will then verify the stats in our software program and NFL.com.
The stats on NFL.com that will be used are the stats on the Player Cards,
NOT the Gamebook Stats.  The reason for this can be found on NFL.com's FAQs:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Q. Are statistics on the Gamebooks official?</B><BR>
A. No. Gamebooks are prepared on site at each game using data
available immediately following the completion of a game. They are
intended to provide a snapshot of the game's action and are not updated
after stats are made official on Monday mornings. Please note that scoring
decisions made on game days are reviewed and frequently adjusted
before becoming official. See the Stats section of the site or a player's
player card to find official statistics. The best way to locate an
individual
player card is through the search tool on the Players Index. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>While in most cases our software program has the correct stats, there have
been some cases where they were wrong.  When the Offical stats on NFL.com do
not match the software, the offical NFL.com stats will be used (see above
for definition of offical stats).  The exception being if a scoring change
is made more than 36 hours after the completion of Monday night's game, the
original score will remain.</P>

<P>Hopefully, that policy is clear, if you have questions about it let me know.
Which brings me to the question of how this relates to this week.  In the
NFL.com Gamebook stats as well as in the USA Today, Jevon Kearse did not
score any points, however, in our stats he was given credit for 1/2 a sack.
After further research, it appeared that Yahoo, WashingtonPost.com and the
player log on NFL.com all gave him credit for the 1/2 sack.  This is what
led me to the above information.  Since, the offical NFL.com stats say that
Kearse got a 1/2 sack, that ruling will stand.  As a result, the scores and
stats listed in yesterday's reports are correct.  Hopefully, this issue is
resolved to the satisfaction of everyone involved.  Thank you.</P>

Commissioner WMFFL</B></P>
