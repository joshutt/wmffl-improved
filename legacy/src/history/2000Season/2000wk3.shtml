WMFFL Newsletter Week #3
Home Page: http://wmffl.com
=======================================================
A quick note on this week's financial situation.  The
following teams were fines $1 each for activating
players on a bye or an illegal lineup:
    Norsemen
    ZEN
    Archers Who Say Ni
    Hempaholics
    Penis Lovers

The following teams still have not paid thier entry
fees and have been accessed a $5 fee for being over a
month late.  Included is how much they currently owe
(current winnings are included)
  ZEN             $59.06
  Barbarians      $50.50
  Penis Lovers    $64.00

Any of these three teams can make payment to me, either
via PayPal at ************** via mail at
  43511 Blacksmith Sq
  Ashburn, VA    20147

Finally,  I have come to a very unfortunate and
undesireable decision.  I think that we should place up
for immediate vote, the removal of Bryan Jones' team.  He
hasn't paid his fee, he didn't attend the draft, he hasn't
picked a head coach or a name for his team and he hasn't
turned in a single activation.  In fact, I haven't heard
from him in over a month.  Since it is mid-season this
will require a unanimous vote.  I was thinking that it
would work something like this: his team would cease to
exist, the players on his team would be redistributed to
the league in a supplemental draft style, based on reverse
order of current standings.  When a team is scheduled to
play him, it will be considered a bye and the games that
he already played will be nullified.  The only alternative
that I can think of is to find someone to take control of
his team, but I think that is doubtful.  I would like to
hear everone's opinion on this matter as soon as possible.
Thanks.
