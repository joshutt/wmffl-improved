<H1 ALIGN=Center>Letter from the Commissioner</H1>

<HR size = "1">

<P>Hey all,</P>
<P>Just thought that I would give everyone a quick update on a status of the
league.  First off, I assume that everyone intends on returning to the WMFFL
this season, but, let me know whether you will infact be back, so that
arrangements can be made.  Keep in mind that the draft is tentativly
scheduled for August 12th (the 2nd Sat in August, read the rules).  I'll
send out a mail in a couple weeks to confirm that this date will work.</P>

<P>Finally, after talking with a couple people, it seems that the consensus
is to expand by two teams this year.  I already have a number of potential
canadates, but if you know someone that would like to join send me thier
email.  The deadline for applying will be June 10.  I hope to put it to a
league vote not long after that.  That way we can figure out how the
expansion draft, protections, etc will work.  Finally, if you have any new
rule proposals please submit them via the web page.</P>

<P>In summary</P>
<OL>
