<H1 ALIGN=Center>Letter from the Commissioner</H1>
<H5 ALIGN=Center><I>July 5, 2000</I></H5>
<HR size = "1">

<P>
It was announced today that the ninth and tenth franchises in the WMFFL have been
awarded to Mike Atlas and Bryan Jones.  Mike is a friend of mine from work and is
an avid football and Redskins fan.  Bryan, of course, needs no introduction as
most of us have known him for years.  Since Bryan was suggested by Warren and Mike
by myself, I think that the most sensible division alignment is to place Bryan in
the Orange Division (with Barbarians, Crusaders, Green Wave and ZEN) and Mike in
the Blue Division (with Archers Who Say Ni, Hempaholics, Norsemen and Werewolves).
This announcement will become offical, as soon as the league votes on it.  The
deadline for the vote is Tuesday, July 11.
