<P>
The approval of the expansion teams to Mike Atlas and Bryan Jones have been
completed.  With 6 votes in favor, no votes against and 2 votes not yet
collected, it is offical.  Mike Atlas' team will be called the Freezer Burn
and is a full voting member of the league effective immediatly.  Bryan Jones'
team is yet to be named and will become a full member of the league upon
reciept of his $50 entry fee.

<P>
There is still debate as to how these teams will be stocked with players.
There are three competing proposals.  Please take a look at them and consider
them, we will need to vote on them very soon.
<UL>
<LI>No expansion draft.  Picks 1 and 2 of regular draft go to expansion
teams.  Every other pick in the first quarter goes to an expansion team
in alternating fashion (ie, pick 4 to team A, pick 6 to team B, pick 8 to
team B, pick 10 to team A, etc).
<LI>Existing teams use protections as normal.  Before the draft each
expansion team picks one unprotected player from each position, excluding
rookies.
<LI>Existing teams use protections as normal, however they can only use
6 on protection day.  Before the regular draft, the expansion teams will
alternate picking players from the unprotected rosters.  When an existing
team losses a player to an expansion team, they may protect two more players
(subject to standard protection rules).
