<H1 ALIGN=Center>Letter from the Commissioner</H1>
<H5 ALIGN=Center><I>August 28, 2000</I></H5>
<HR size = "1">

<P>A couple of things... </P>

<P>First, the team-by-team rosters are finally up on the web page.  They are
updated through right . . . now.  The transaction list is updated as well.
Remember that everyone has 4 pre-season transaction that will disappear
Sunday at 12:00 if unused.  Also, remember that transaction points are used
when you pick a player up, not when you drop them.</P>

<P>
Remember activations for week 1 are due by noon on Sunday.  The full
schedule can been seen on the web page. </P>

<P>
Once again this season, I strongly urge everyone to make use of the FLM
software's Owners Assistant.  It lets you get the full stats for every
player, see who is available, etc.  More information is available on the web
page.  The league file is also up there available for downloading.  This
year, you will need to unzip the league file.  Also, if you use the
software, make sure that you have the Owner's Version, otherwise it will
expire after week 6.</P>

<P>
Now for a brief moment for public humilation.  The following people still
own entry fees to the league, as usual the fee will be increased $5 each
month until they pay and they will be inelgible for the playoffs if they
haven't payed.  You can pay via PayPal to ************** or you can mail me
a check at <BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;address omitted from web page&gt;</BLOCKQUOTE>
The people are: Warren owes $56, Keppy owes $47.47, Ira owes $56 and Bryan
Jones owes $56.</P>


<P>Now for more public humilation.  Bryan Jones still doesn't have a head coach
or a team name.  Everyone should laugh at him and mock him until he does.
Until then his team will informally be called the Losers Without a Name. </P>

<P>
<B>Josh <BR>
Commissioner WMFFL</B></P>
