<p><b>Proposal 2009.3 - Free Market Protection Costs</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Werewolves</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">On Ballot</font></a><br/>
The protection cost of a position will be based on a free market system.  If the number of players protected at a position in the previous 4 years is too high, then the cost of that position increases, and vice versa.  A position is considered to be too high or too low if the number protected is outside the range of +/- 5 from the target.  The four year range is reset when the cost changes.  The targets will be 1 player per team per position per year, except for RB which will be 1.5, WR which will be 1.25 and LB which will be 1.25.
<blockquote><i>Add rule X.F reading:
    <blockquote>The target number of protections for each position each year shall be equal to their target number times the number of teams in the league.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Target numbers<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. RB<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. 1.5<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. WR and LB<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. 1.25<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. All other positions<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. 1<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;2. The number of protections at each position in the shorter of the previous 4 years or years since the last position cost change for the position shall be compared to the target number of protections over that same time frame.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. If the number of actual protections exceeds the targeted protections by more than 5, then the appropriate position in rule X.E.1 shall have their point value increased by 1.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If the targeted number of protections exceeds the actual number of protections by more than 5, then the appropriate position in rule X.E.1 shall have their point value decreased by 1.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. However no position shall have it's value decreased below 1.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;3. The calculation for a given season shall be determined after protections are due and announced at the draft.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The changes will take effect the following season.</blockquote>

<b>Sponsor: Fighting Squirrels</b><br/>

Eliminate the draft lottery and move to a reverse order of finish draft.  Effective 2010.
<blockquote><i>Repeal rule VI.D.3.b<br/>

</i></blockquote>
