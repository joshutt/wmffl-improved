<p>This is the list of proposals to be voted on for the 2018 WMFFL season.
If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may

each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>

<b>Proposal 2018.1 - Add Home Field Advantage</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Steve Schillinger</b><br/>
<span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Withdrawn</span></span><br/>
Add a home field advantage that will be small, maybe 2 points.  There would be a number of factors that can adjust that
up or down.  If the team is on a winning streak the points would be higher and would be lower for a losing streak.  A team
in first place would get a slight bump as well.  The exact details will be worked out later.
<blockquote><i>Details TBD</i></blockquote>

<b>Proposal 2018.2 - Adjust Game Plan For to 50%</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Josh Utterback</b><br/>
<span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Withdrawn due to 2018.4</span></span><br/>
Game planning for scores too many points.  Adjust it to match the Game Plan Against score, which is 50% of the base score.
<blockquote><i>Update rule V.D.1 to read:
        <blockquote>1. The player on their team that is game planned for will have their score increased by 50%, with fractions rounded down.<br/>

    <b>Proposal 2018.3 - Negative Game Plan For Increase Not Decrease</b><br/>
    <b>Sponsor: Brian Elliff</b><br/>
    <span class="ballot">Status: <span class="status">Withdrawn due to 2018.4</span></span><br/>
A game planned for player that scores negative has their score doubled (from -8 to -16).  Reverse that and half it.
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.D.1.a to read:
        <blockquote>a. If a game planned for player scores negative their score will be halved, not doubled.<br/>
