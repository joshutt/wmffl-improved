<p>This is the list of proposals to be voted on for the 2005 WMFFL season.
If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may
    do so on the <a href="proposesubmit.php">proposals page</a>. The part of
each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>


<p><b>Proposal 2004.2a - 0-0 Tie Breaker</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: MeggaMen</b><br/>
<font color="red">Status: Passed (6-3, 1 Abstain)</font><br/>
In the event that two teams playing each other both have negative scores and
thus the scores are reset to 0-0, the team that has the better total score
will win by a score of 1-0.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.C.2.b to read the following:
<blockquote>If the score of both teams equals 0, the team who scored the most combined points will recieve a 1 point bonus and win the game 1-0.</blockquote>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.1 - Replacement Coach</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Gallic Warriors</b><br/>
Teams may select a replacement coach for their coach's bye week.  Such a 
replacement may only be done once a season, even if a team replaces their coach
mid-season.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.A.2.a reading the following:
        <blockquote>Once a season a team may, in place of a HC on thier roster, activate a HC not on thier roster, or any other team's roster.  Points will be scored for this HC as if they were on that team's roster.
        </blockquote>
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.2 - Define a player</b><br/>
Due to a conflict that occurred last season regarding Ricky Williams, clarify
the common sense definition of a player.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule IV.A.1 reading:
        <blockquote>A player is any person currently, or previously on an NFL roster</blockquote>
Move rule IV.C to IV.A.2
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.3 - Bench Players</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Norsemen</b><br/>
At any point after activations are due and prior to the start of a given NFL 
game, any player on a team participating in that game may be benched. This will
result in a score of 0 being scored for that particular player. The player may
not be replaced with another player, nor will thie benching result in the loss
of any penalty that would result from an illegal or bye week activation.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.A.4 reading:
        <blockquote>4. Any point after the activation deadline and prior to the start of the NFL game in which an activated player or unit is participating, that player may be removed from the activation roster.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The removed player may not be replaced by another player<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Removing a player that would have accumulated a penalty due to an illegal activation or bye week activation does not remove the penalty.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The score of the removed player will be considered to be 0, regardless of the actual performance of that player.</blockquote>
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.4 - Runningback Tandems</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Norsemen</b><br/>
If two runningbacks from the same NFL team are activated by the same WMFFL team,
their stats will be combined for the purpose of calculating their score. They 
will still count as two seperate activated players, but will receive a single
combined score.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.A.2.a (or V.A.2.b if 2005.1 passes):<br/>
        <blockquote>When a team activates two RBs on the same NFL team their stats will be combined for the purposes of calculating their weekly score.
        </blockquote>
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.5 - Increase Weekly Payouts</b><br/>
<b>Sponser: Whiskey Tango</b><br/>
Increase the financial payout per win as the season progresses. To encourage
winning, even late in the season.  This plan calls for weeks 1-4 to be worth
.5 wins, weeks 5-8 to be worth .75 wins, weeks 9-11 to be worth 1 win and weeks
12-14 to be worth 2 wins, when calculating the payouts for winning games.
Alternative payoff plans are welcome.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Amend XI.C.2.b<br/>
        <blockquote>b. Each team will receive the weekly winning amount times the number of win points they accumulate.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Every win a team gets in weeks 1 through 4 will count as 0.5 win points<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Every win a team gets in weeks 5 through 8 will count as 0.75 win points<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. Every win a team gets in weeks 9 through 11 will count as 1 win point<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. Every win a team gets in weeks 12 through 14 will count as 2 win points<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v. Any week in which a team ties, they will receive half the number of win points they would have received had they won.</blockquote>
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.6 - Late Pickups Cost more to Protect</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Werewolves</b><br/>
Any player picked up after week 10 will cost 1 extra point to protect. The 
extra protection only applies to the next season (it doesn't carry over to
following seasons) and doesn't apply to traded players, unless the traded
player already falls under this rule.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule X.E.2.c<br/>
        <blockquote>c. A player picked up off waivers or free agency after the time activations are due in week 10 of the previous season will receive an additional modifier of +1.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. This modifier will only apply to a single season and will be removed before the standard modifier adjustment.</blockquote>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.7 - New Bug Stompers Owner</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Illuminati</b><br/>
<font color="red">Status: Passed (8-0, 1 No Vote)</font><br/>
Ayrik Moran will take over ownership of the Bug Stompers.</p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.8a - Transaction Deadline moved to Week 11</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Illuminati</b><br/>
Move the transaction deadline to when activations are due for week 11.  Any 
waiver pick placed prior to the activations that week will be resolved on
the following Tuesday.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Amend rule IX.F to read:<br/>
    <blockquote>F. No pickups are allowed after activations are due in week 11, until the following draft.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Any unresolved waiver claims made prior to the deadline will be resolved the Tuesday following the deadline.</blockquote>
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.8b - Transaction Deadline moved to End of Season</b><br/>
Move the transaction deadline to when activations are due for the last game of the regular season.  No waivers will be resolved for that final week.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Amend rule IX.F to read:<br/>
    <blockquote>F. No pickups are allowed after activations are due for the last game of the regular season, until the following draft.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. No waivers claims will be resolved following the regular season.</blockquote>
</i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2005.8c - Limit Playoff Transactions</b><br/>
Keeps the transaction deadline where it is, but eliminates the waiver wire in Championship week.  Also would limit playoff activations to players on the roster at the time activations are due in week 14.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.A.2.a</br>
    <blockquote>a. In the post-season no player may be active that was not on that team's roster as of the moment activations are due for the final game of the regular season.</blockquote>
Add rule IX.F.1</br>
    <blockquote>1. No waiver claims will be resolved following the Championship game.</blockquote>
