Currently, when two teams are playing each other and the final scores are

<P><B>Proposal 2002.11 - Kicker Penalties</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="red">Status: Failed 2-6 with 2 No Votes</FONT><BR>
There is no excuse for a kicker missing an extra point.  Up the penalty
on missed extra points and field goals under 30 yards to 3.  Missed
field goals between 30-39 should have a -2 penalty and 40-49 should
have -1.  Missed field goals 50 and over would not recieve penalty.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Amend rule V.B.5.a.ii to read "Missed = -3 pts"<BR>

<P><B>Proposal 2002.12 - Individual Head Coaches</B><BR>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Status: Passed 6-1 with 1 Abstain and 2 No Votes</FONT><BR>
Treat head coaches as individuals and not units.  Thus, when Tony Dungy

Tony Dungy in Indianapolis.  If a team's coach is not coaching any team
they may select a new head coach as they would any other time.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Amend rule IV.B.10 to read "Head Coach"<BR>
Amend rule IX.H.3 to read "If a team wishes to fire their head coach

coach of an NFL team or if all of the following are true:"

slower rate that defensive players do, instead of the faster rate of
offensive players.<BR>

Amend rule X.E.2.b to read "K, OL, DL, LB and DB"
