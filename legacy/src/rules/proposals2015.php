<h1 align=center>Current Rule Proposals</h1>
<hr SIZE = "1"/>

<p>This is the list of proposals to be voted on for the 2015 WMFFL season.
If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may
do so on the <a href="proposesubmit.php">proposals page</a>.  The part of
each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>

<b>Proposal 2014.1 - Increase entry fee to $100</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Tom Marsh</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Failed - 5-6, 1 abstain</font></a><br/>
 I propose raising the yearly fee from $75 to $100.  There has been some discussion over the past couple years about lack of participation by some of the league members (not trading, responding to requests, etc) so I'm thinking maybe raising the cost might get people more involved?
<blockquote><i>Amend rule IX.A by changing "$75" to "$100"</i></blockquote>

<b>Proposal 2015.1 - Make the defense more flexible</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Warren Allen</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Failed - 5-6, 1 abstain</font></a><br/>
Require that one of the defensive line be a defensive tackle.  Then add a flex defensive player.  This would make the defensive line-up 2 DL (1 must be DT), 2 LB, 2 DB and 1 flex.
<blockquote><i>Amend rule V.A.2 to say: "An active roster includes 1 HC, 1 QB, 1 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 OL, 2 DL (at least one being a DT), 2 LB, 2 DB, 1 additional player at either RB, WR or TE and 1 additional player at either DL, LB or DB."</i></blockquote>

<b>Proposal 2015.2 - League Champion Renames Toilet Bowl Loser</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Tom Marsh and Josh Utterback</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">On Ballot</font></a><br/>
At the end of the season the League Champion can rename the Toilet Bowl loser's team.  They have to keep this name until they either make the playoffs, lose the Toilet Bowl again or change owners.
<blockquote><i>Update rule III.E to read:
    <blockquote>E. The two last place teams in each division with the worse records will play in week 15 for the Toilet Bowl<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The loser of the Toilet Bowl will have their team renamed by the League Champion<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The team must keep their new name until one of the following occurs<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The team qualifies for the playoffs<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The team changes owners<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The team loses the Toilet Bowl again and gets renamed by the Champion<br/>

<b>Proposal 2015.3 - Increase Free Transactions to 15</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Chris Heywood</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Passed, 8-2, 2 abstain</font></a><br/>
Increase the number of free transactions from 5 to 15.  With limited rosters, injuries, bye weeks, etc., 5 is too few.
<blockquote><i>Amend rule IX.C.2 by changing "5" to "15"</i></blockquote>
