<p>This is the list of proposals to be voted on for the 2004 WMFFL season.
If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may
    do so on the <a href="proposesubmit.php">proposals page</a>. The part of
each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>


<p><b>Proposal 2003.4 - Toliet Bowl Draft Pick</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Werewolves</b><br/>
<font color="red">Status: Rejected (4-5, 1 abstain)</font><br/>
The Toliet Bowl loser can not be selected in the draft lottery.  They would
receive whatever draft position they would have received if they had been in
the lottery but not been selected.  This would not effect the weight that each
team receives.<br/>
<blockquote><i>Add rule VI.D.3.b.iii to read the following:
<blockquote>The loser of the previous year's Toliet Bowl will have a weight of 0.
</blockquote></i></blockquote></p>

<p><b>Proposal 2004.1 - Waiver Wire</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Werewolves</b><br/>
<font color="red">Status: Passed (7-1, 2 no Votes)</font><br/>
Implement a waiver wire system to allow players to be picked up in a more fair
manner than just first come, first serve.  Between the time activations are due
for a given week, through the games for that week, players may not be picked up
in the usual manner, but a waiver request may be placed for them.  If a team
submits multiple waiver requests in a given week they should prioritize the
requests.  On Tuesday, all requests are processed by going through each team in
waiver order taking their top priority request that is available.  After the
requests are processed transactions occur as normal until activations are due
for that week, with the sole exception that any player cut by a team must pass
through waivers before he can be picked up.</p>
<p>Since it is uncertain how many players will be taken off of waivers, this
proposal also provides for roster limits to be exceed.  However, if the roster
limit is exceed at the activation deadline, all players picked up by that team
in that week (by any method, including trades) would be automaticlly cut.</p>
<blockquote><i>Add rule IX.E to read the following:
<blockquote>E. Between the time activations are due for a given week and 1:00pm Eastern Time on the following Tuesday players may only be picked up via the waiver wire.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. All teams should list any players they would like to select off of waivers and order them in the priority they would like to receive them.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. At 1:00pm Eastern Time on Tuesday the waiver requests will be resolved.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Each team's waiver requests will be considered in the current waiver order<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. When a team is considered they will recieve as a pickup the highest priority player that is available.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Once a team picks up a player via waivers they are moved to the bottom of the waiver list and the next team in order is considered.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. If a team has no requested players available or did not request any players, then they remain at thier location in the waiver order and the next team is considered.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Waiver consideration proceeds until there are no remaining waiver requests<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Once waiver requests are resolved, players may be picked up freely.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Any player dropped by a team in a given week will only be available through the waiver wire for that week.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The team dropping a player may not pick that player back up until the completion of the next waiver wire.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Any team that has a number of players exceeding the total allowable roster limit, at the time activations are due for a given week, will be required to drop all players picked up that week.</blockquote>
