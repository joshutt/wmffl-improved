<h1 align=center>Current Rule Proposals</h1>
<hr SIZE = "1"/>

<p>This is the list of proposals to be voted on for the 2014 WMFFL season.
If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may
do so on the <a href="proposesubmit.php">proposals page</a>.  The part of
each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2013.1a - Realignment, Simple</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Commissioner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Defeated 5-6</font></a><br/>
Swap one team from the division with the best record over the last three years, with one team from the division with the worst record over the last three years in a way that minimizes the difference in records.

<b>Proposal 2014.1 - Increase entry fee to $100</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: MeggaMen</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">On Ballot</font></a><br/>
 I propose raising the yearly fee from $75 to $100.  There has been some discussion over the past couple years about lack of participation by some of the league members (not trading, responding to requests, etc) so I'm thinking maybe raising the cost might get people more involved?
<blockquote><i>Amend rule IX.A by changing "$75" to "$100"</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2014.2 - Thrown Pick-6 cost 6 points</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: MeggaMen</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Defeated 2-6, 2 abstain, 1 no vote</font></a><br/>
 I propose a rule that QB's that throw a pick-6 get -6 points instead of just the -2 for an int.  I'm not sure if this is something you can even do but it might be a fun little scoring twist to put in place (of course, with Stafford on my team, I'd probably be hurting myself the most).
<blockquote><i>Add rule V.B.2.c.iii that reads: "Interception returned for TD = -6 pts"</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2014.3 - Commission an new trophy</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Commissioner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Passed 8-1, 1 abstain, 1 no vote</font></a><br/>
Since Byron has refused to turn over the trophy for three seasons now and the old trophy is out of space to list winners.  Create a three person trophy committee that will be responsible for finding and purchasing a new trophy for the league.  In addition add a clause to the rules prohibiting Byron from ever being allowed to posses this new trophy.
<blockquote><i>No rule change required to create a new trophy<br/>
Add rule III.D.1 reading:
<blockquote>1. The Champion is entitled to keep the league trophy until a new champion is determined.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Within 60 days of losing rights to the trophy, the trophy should be delivered to the new Champion or the commissioner.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Failure to deliever the trophy will result in a $10 fine and being added to the No Trophy List for five years for every 30 days past due.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Byron Williams is permenantly on the No Trophy List.<br/>
2. If the Champion is on the No Trophy List, they will not be entitled to the trophy and the league will keep it in safe keeping.<br/>

<b>Proposal 2014.4 - New Owner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Passed, 8-0, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
Install Brian Elliff as the new owner of the Fighting Squirrels.
