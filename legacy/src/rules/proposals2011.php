If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may

each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2011.1 - Weekly Point Total Prize</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Fighting Squirrels</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 2-7, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
The team with the highest point total each week wins $5. The goal of this is to motivate the teams with losing records to still put effort into winning each week.
<blockquote><i>Move rule XI.C.2.b to XI.C.2.c<br/>
	Move rule XI.C.2.a to XI.C.2.b and insert the word "remaining" between "The" and "weekly", update "currently 70" to "currently 84".<br/>
	Add rule XI.C.2.a reading: "The highest point scorer each week will receive $5".</i></blockquote>

Revise the protection points by decreasing the points per team to 55, increase base cost of RBs by 2, QB and WR by 1.  Also put in a clause that will 
increase a position's cost if too many players are protected.
<blockquote><i>In rule X.A replace "65" with "55"<br/>
	Change rule X.E.1.a.1 to "10 pts"<br/>
	Change rule X.E.1.b.1 to "12 pts"<br/>

	<blockquote>2. Modifiers are based on position and number of previous years protected.<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;a. QB, RB, WR and TE<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. +1 for per year<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;b. K, OL, DL, LB and DB<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. +1 for every 2 years, rounded up</blockquote>
	Add rule X.E.5 that reads:<br/>
	<blockquote>If more than 16 players are protected in the same year at the same position then the cost of that position in rule X.E.1 will be 
	increased by 1, to take effect the following season</blockquote>
