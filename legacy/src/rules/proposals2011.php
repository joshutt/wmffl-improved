<b>Proposal 2011.1 - Weekly Point Total Prize</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Fighting Squirrels</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 2-7, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
The team with the highest point total each week wins $5. The goal of this is to motivate the teams with losing records to still put effort into winning each week.
<blockquote><i>Move rule XI.C.2.b to XI.C.2.c<br/>
	Move rule XI.C.2.a to XI.C.2.b and insert the word "remaining" between "The" and "weekly", update "currently 70" to "currently 84".<br/>
	Add rule XI.C.2.a reading: "The highest point scorer each week will receive $5".</i></blockquote>

Revise the protection points by decreasing the points per team to 55, increase base cost of RBs by 2, QB and WR by 1.  Also put in a clause that will 
increase a position's cost if too many players are protected.

	Add rule X.E.5 that reads:<br/>

	increased by 1, to take effect the following season</blockquote>
