<hr SIZE = "1"/>

<p>This is the list of proposals to be voted on for the 2013 WMFFL season.
If you would like to suggest a rule proposal, you may
    do so on the <a href="proposesubmit.php">proposals page</a>. The part of
each proposal that appears in <i>Italics</i> is what effect this proposal will
have on the ruleset, if passed.</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2013.1a - Realignment, Simple</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Commissioner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">On Ballot</font></a><br/>
Swap one team from the division with the best record over the last three years, with one team from the division with the worst record over the last three years in a way that minimizes the difference in records.
<blockquote><i>No rule change required</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2013.1b - Realignment, More Complicated</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Commissioner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 2-6, 1 abstain, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
Seed every team based on record over the last three years and group them into new divisions so that teams 1,6,7 and 12 are in one division, teams 2, 5, 8 and 11 in another and 3, 4, 9 and 10 in the last.
<blockquote><i>No rule change required</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2013.1c - Realignment, Radical</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Commissioner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 3-8, 1 no vote </font></a><br/>
Return to two divisions by abolishing one division and putting the teams evenly into the other two divisions in a way that balances the three year record between the two divisions.  Doing this the schedule will be the first 11 weeks of the season every team will play every other team once.  Then the bottom two teams from each division will be eliminated and play a round-robin over the last three games, the Toilet Bowl would be eliminated.  The remaining four teams in each division would play each other over the last three weeks, with the best record in those games winning the division (tiebreak would be overall record).  Two wild card teams would also make the playoffs based on overall record.  All four playoff teams would be seeded 1-4 based on overall record, without regard to division titles.
<blockquote><i>TBD</i></blockquote>

<b>Proposal 2013.1d - Realignment, Relegation</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Commissioner</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 1-6, 2 abstain, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
Embrace that one division will always be better and switch to a relegation system.  The divisions are ranked Burgundy, Gold and White.  When a team wins the division in the Gold or White they are promoted to the next division up, teams that finish in last in Burgundy or Gold move down a division.  This would happen every year.
<blockquote><i>Add rule I.C:
<blockquote>Each division will be identified as first, second or third division<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Division winners for each division other than the first division, will be promoted to the next division up the following season<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The fourth place team in each division, other than the third division, will be relegated to the next division down the following season

<b>Proposal 2013.2 - Allow Transactions in Playoffs</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: MeggaMen with Werewolves</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Passed, 8-3, 1 no vote</font></a><br/>
Modify the no playoff transactions rule to allow pickups in the playoffs as long as the player was not on another team's roster in week 14 or later.
<blockquote><i>Modify rule V.A.5 to read "No player may be activated for a team in the postseason if that player
appeared on another teams' roster after the point activations were due for the final week of the regular season</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2013.3 - Cap Protection Point Growth at 8 years</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor: Norsemen</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 2-7, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
Change the cost of protections to include a cap on how much each player can cost.
<blockquote><i>Add rule X.E.2.c reading:
<blockquote>After 8 years, players will not accumulate additional protection points</blockquote>
</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Proposal 2013.4 - Add 4 rounds to Draft</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor:  Werewolves</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Passed, 8-0, 1 abstain, 3 no votes</font></a><br/>
Extend the draft from 12 rounds to 16 rounds.  At the same time revamp the timing, so that instead of 2 minutes per pick, each team gets 2 minutes for the
whole draft, then 30 seconds added on when their pick comes around.  Left over time would remain until the next pick.  (eg, if a team had 1:45 left on their
clock, when their next pick came around it would increase by 30 seconds to 2:15.  If they then took 20 seconds they would have 1:55 left.  So the overall
clock could grow.)  Clock growth would be capped at 5 minutes.
<blockquote><i>In rule VI.D.1 change the word "three" to "four"<br/>
Replace rule VII.B to read:
<blockquote>B. Each team will have a draft clock that runs during their picks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Each team's clock will start at 2 minutes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. When a team goes on the clock for each pick, 30 seconds will be added to their clock<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If a team's clock reaches 0:00 their pick will be auto selected.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. At no time may a team's clock be larger than 5 minutes

<b>Proposal 2013.5 - Luxury Tax/Handi-cap Protections</b><br/>
<b>Sponsor:  Woodland Rangers</b><br/>
<a class="ballot">Status: <font color="red">Rejected, 2-7, 3 No Votes</font></a><br/>
Having played in other FFLs, I found the uniqueness of the protections a bit refreshing from the all keeper leagues and the re-draft leagues. Having to choose each year who to keep or who let go becomes a very crucial process. It could make or break a team in come cases.  There are some coaches who may like to keep a certain player(s) for whatever reason, but can't due to being a point or two short, and no one willing or able to trade away their protection points.  Here is my proposal. A coach may protect X amount of players up to 10 max protection points over the protection point limit, but will incur a game handi-cap penalty of the amount of points equal to what the team is over.<br/>
Example:<br/>
Werewolves have used all 56 of their PP. They have 2 Defensive players they really want to keep Crayola Washington 4 Points, and Centurayon Jones 4 Points,  for a toal of 8 points. That 8 points over will now be 8 points for all of the Werewolves opponents for the entire season. Every opponent will be "spotted" 8 points before the ball is snapped.<br/>
 Dropping players will lower the cost of the penalty. So if the Werewolves drop Joseph Wladislaw 9 points, then the will be under the PP limit (55) and then not incur a penalty.<br/>
Season to taste, but just a general idea.
<blockquote><i>Add the following sub-rules to X.A: <br/>
1. A team may purchase up to 10 additional protection points.<br/>
2. For each protection point purchased the team will give a bonus of that much to their opponents each week during the regular season
